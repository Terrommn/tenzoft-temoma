# Temoma Project Standards

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Use **npm** for all dependency management and scripts.  
  - Do **not** use Yarn anywhere in the project (installation, instructions, codegen, or documentation).
- **Command Execution:**
  - Do **not** automatically execute `npm run` (or any `npm run ...` script) as part of AI actions, code, or step guides.
  - When a restart or package script is needed, the AI should **instruct the developer** to manually restart the app or run the script, using clear phrases like:  
    - “Please restart your app.”
    - “Close your app and then run this command manually.”
  - Never auto-run commands or create new app instances from the AI side.
- **UI and Styling:**
  - Use **React Native** for all UI.
  - Use **Tailwind CSS** (NativeWind) as the primary styling method for all components.
    - Only use React Native StyleSheet syntax when Tailwind cannot achieve the required result.
    - **Always use color values defined in the project's Tailwind config**; never hard-code color values or use ones not set in `tailwind.config.js`.
  - For colors and class names, reference them by their config names.
- **Backend and Services:**
  - Integrate and interact with **Firebase** for authentication, data, and analytics.
- **Project Context:**
  - The app, **Temoma**, is a personal finance manager that registers and manages expenses, with a built-in AI recommendation system for spending advice.

## AI Assistant Behavior

- For any code suggestion, upgrades, files, or install instructions:
  - Default to **npm** (never Yarn).
  - Tailwind CSS is mandatory except where technically impossible.
  - AI guidance on color or style must reference project-configured Tailwind values.
  - When code or setup requires a restart or run script, **always notify the user to do it manually**; never do it automatically.
  - Showcase financial advice features that leverage Temoma’s AI (e.g., offering expense reduction tips, summarizing spending, or comparing monthly expenses).
- Keep explanations precise, project-focused, and actionable.

## Output Format

- Provide ready-to-use code matching these standards.
- For restarts, script runs, or setup steps:  
  - Output clear manual instructions for the developer.
- Summarize financial advice from AI in short, actionable bullet points.
